# Xamarin-Layouts
Sample Xamarin solution to experiment with Xamarin.Forms layouts. The layouts are presented within Hamburger Menu navigation UI built from a MasterDetailPage in Xamarin.Forms. The Xamarin.Android app also contains custom styling elements to provide a UI based on Material Design even on devices running a version of Android below 5.0.

This is a work in progress and i will add more page layouts as I prototype UI designs for other Xamarin projects, some of which are private. It only contains a grid layout for now.
